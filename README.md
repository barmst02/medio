Medio: Media organizer for Synology NAS devices
===============================================

Automatically renames and moves images based on EXIF data from a configurable
source directory into a configurable destination directory.  This is handy for 
dumping your camera roll into the source directory and having it organized into
your destination directory.

Take a look at the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/polandj/medio/wiki/Home) to learn more about this package.

You can install this package on your Synology by adding **https://www.cphub.net** as a Package Source in **Package Center**.

If you are interested in helping out with this project, please let me know, I will happily add collaborators.
